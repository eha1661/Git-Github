# Notes 

## strategies for undoing things in Git

* `git checkout` is used to move around and review the commit history (you can undo changes but it's not recommended)
* `git revert` is the best tool for undoing shared public changes
* `git reset` is best used for undoing local private changes
* `git clean` is used for undoing uncommitted changes
