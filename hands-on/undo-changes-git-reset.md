# Git Reset

## Theory

The git reset has three primary forms of invocation. These forms correspond to command line arguments `--soft`, `--mixed`, `--hard`. The three arguments each correspond to Git's three internal state management mechanism's, `The Commit Tree (HEAD)`, `The Staging Index`, and `The Working Directory`

Three trees of git:

* working directory
* staging index
* Commit history
